# Data Quality Report (Playstation Tweets)
## The dataset contains columns that are completely null and another column with only one value. The columns which are nothing but null are the following: 'near','geo','source','user_rt_id','user_rt','retweet_id','retweet_date','translate','trans_src','trans_dest' and the column with only one value is the ‘retweet’ column which contains row values of false and no true. 
## Furthermore the dataset contains very recent data can be considered highly relevant to our research.
