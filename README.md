# Business Understanding Phase
## 1.1 Business Objectives:
Playstation is looking for a an analyst as a part of their Audience team. This position is pivotal as this will entail a vital role in shaping 
communication with consumers. Playstation wants to initiate a global marketing strategy to reach all of its customers. The objectives 
include figuring out how best to reach customers, how to drive up engagement, promote subscription growth of its popular Playstation Plus online service.
Success will be measured through how well we meaure up when compared to our key performance indicators and how well we can implement and deploy our project plan. 

## 1.2 Assess Situation
Understand the current main revenue sources and main products of playstation. Including video game consoles, media center's usage and user reviews. 
What efforts and improvements have PlayStation made to maintain and develop these products. Learn the company's development strategy and marketing strategy. 
For example, using different subscription models to attract customers to comsume. The last is  research the risks the company faces. 
These risks come from both internal and external sources. Employees are not satisfied with the company's treatment. And there are strong competitors outside.

### Terminology

Text mining: is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new insights.

Sentiment Analysis: is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helps a business to 
understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.

Customer segmentation: is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively 
and appropriately.

Customer targeting: is the act of reaching out to a portion of your customer list to re-engage them and drive sales.

API: stands for application programming interface, which is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.

Costs and Benefits

Some of the costs would be the data as it can be very expensive and have a very large volume. Meaning it would be expensive or hard to store. 
Time is another big factor, as this time could also be used on other things such as on how PlayStation could stand out more from competitors, like Xbox. 
Manpower would be limited, as many employees from different departments would have to focus on this project instead of working on other important projects.

On the other hand, from this project PlayStation could obtain numerous benefits. First of all, increased customer satisfaction. 
This would be obtained by listening more carefully to our customers and through our sentiment analysis that would search for very useful feedback to 
improve the relationship with customers. Subscriptions for services would also most likely increase as PlayStation would be targeting and segmenting 
their customers more efficiently. Lastly and most importantly, sales and revenue would increase. This is due to PlayStation trying to prioritize their customers, 
being able to reach their correct audience effectively and improving their services.


## 1.3 Determine Data Mining Goals
We are going to use web scraping and calling an API that we learned in the class to find the information we need for the text mining goals part. 
From the information we get, we will figure out at least two data mining goals for the PlayStation and find out which are the prioritize goals 
and reasons behind it. At last, we will determine what are the Success Criteria of the data mining for PlayStation from the information found online 
and understand why.
