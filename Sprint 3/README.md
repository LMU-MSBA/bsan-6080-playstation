# Deliverables for Sprint 3

# Data preparation 
* Cleaned the dataset 
* Mocked more data
* Implemented a AWS database to house the data

# Feature Engineering
* Made assumptions on what models to use
* Explored what features we could potentially used
* Justified feature selection

# Machine Learning Models
* Utilized a sentiment analysis and word cloud to assess the tweets we webscraped on Playstation
* Utilized a logistic regression to build a predictive model to figure out what may influence subcribers based off of simulated data we found
