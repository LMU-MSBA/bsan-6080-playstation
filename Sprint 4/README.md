### We want to see if we include a button on the PlayStation website called “subscriptions” would that make it easier for people to click on it and sign up for PlayStation subscription services. We test this by having a control group that is the normal website and we see the traffic and check what pages people are going to and then we compare it to the challenger group the different version of the website that has the subscription button and we compare the website traffic and see if the subscription numbers increased at all. We want keep the test period to be 1 month so we will have enough sample size for testing. We want the confidence level to be at least 95%. Once we got result from the A/B test, we can add the “subscription” button to the website if we find the challenger group have increased the subscription number.  

## Strategic Dashboard

## Analytical Dashboard
### The KPIs that we were looking at were based on increasing revenues and our marketing strategy. We started with number of subscribers for each country. We have here the top 5 countries based on subscribers. As you can see China has a large chunk of our subscribers. Next, we looked at the top countries by revenue and unsurprisingly, it has a direct relationship with number of subscribers. To delve deeper into our analysis we looked at revenue per customer to see where we’re maximizing our profits. As you can see there are 5 countries with close revenue per customer numbers. When we look at the data these are the countries with the lowest number of subscribers as well.On the bottom you can see the subscribed to lapsed ratio to see where we can target our marketing campaigns to. We also added a filter to analyze our information based on each country.
